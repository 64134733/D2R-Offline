### Where are my save files? 

`C:\Users\<Username>\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected Tech Alpha`

### Where are my screenshots?

`C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\Diablo II\Screenshots`

### Where is my shared stash file located?

`C:\Users\<Username>\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected Tech Alpha\SharedStash_SoftCore.d2i`

This file can be backed up and shared with other players to dupe/transfer items.

### Why can’t I resume playing a previously created character?

Once you quit the game after creating a new character, you will need to use the TCP/IP button and host a game with that character.

Alternatively, you can use the `-FixLocalSave` argument with `D2ROffline.exe` to adjust  your save files to allow offline play, see the Usage section in the [README](readme.md)

### How do I go to Act III, IV, or V?

Use the `-FixLocalSave` argument with `D2ROffline.exe` to adjust your save files to allow offline play, see the Usage section in the [README](readme.md)

### How do I enable ladder runewords?

It varies per install (and it also depends on how fast/slow your computer is, unfortunately), but try playing around with the `-Delay` command on your shortcut/cmd terminal, like this:

`D2R-Offline.exe Game.exe -Delay #`

Some users report using a `-Delay` value of `300` enables these runewords.

### Why is my map overlapping/not displaying properly?

Deleting the `.ma` file for your character’s save will fix it.

### Why does it say that this patch is a virus or trojan?

D2ROffline modifies the memory of another computer process, which looks like suspicious activity under normal use. The .exe is also not currently signed.

You can disable Windows Defender temporarily to download D2ROffline, and you can also add your D2R game folder to the list of antivirus exceptions. Make sure to re-enable Windows Defender after you get everything running.

### Can I import old save files?

Version 1.07 saves created by Hero Editor will import natively. You can also try to modify 1.14d saves using one of the tools below. Once a save has been loaded into D2R, it can’t be used in the old version of the game anymore.

D2ROffline cannot provide support for these tools, use at your own risk and always back up your saves.

### Why does it say “bad quest data” when loading a character?

You have generated a save file with an invalid quest configuration. For example, you may have marked that you completed the cow level without completing the quest to kill Diablo or Baal. If you are generating a character with Hero Editor, be very conservative with what you create.

### My game doesn’t start, it says “Agent Error”

You need to delete the D2R game folder and re-install it from scratch.
